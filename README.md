# .steam_styler{};

Simple, ready-to-use program that alters Steam's library style.

## Purpose

At this point the only change the program does is **REMOVING OF *WHAT'S NEW* SECTION**.

However there are plans to add there more options in the future.

## How to use it?

1. Download this repository anywhere.
2. In *path.txt* file pastle the path to your Steam's *css* folder.
3. Run the executable. Currently named as *ss.exe*.

NOTE: run it **after** Steam launches, otherwise options will reset.
